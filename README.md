# Blinkit_Sales_Analysis_Project
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The aim is to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization by leveraging various KPIs and creating interactive visualizations in Power BI.

Major KPI Requirement :
1. Total Sales:
This KPI represents the total revenue generated from all items sold within a specified period. It provides a high-level view of the business's overall financial performance and helps in understanding the revenue trends over time. This metric can be broken down further by product categories, regions, or time periods to gain deeper insights into sales patterns.

2. Average Sales per Transaction:
This KPI calculates the average revenue generated per sale or transaction. It is derived by dividing the total sales revenue by the total number of transactions within a given timeframe. This metric offers insights into customer spending behavior and helps identify opportunities to increase transaction values through cross-selling or upselling strategies.

3. Number of Items Sold:
This KPI tracks the total quantity of individual items sold during a specific period. It provides a clear picture of product popularity and demand trends, enabling better inventory management and forecasting. Analyzing this metric by product category or region can highlight areas of strong performance and potential growth opportunities.

4. Average Customer Rating:
This KPI measures the overall satisfaction of customers based on the ratings they provide for purchased items. It is calculated as the average of all ratings received during a defined period. A high average rating indicates strong customer satisfaction and product quality, while a lower rating may signal areas that require improvement. This metric can be segmented by product category, time period, or customer demographics for more granular insights into customer preferences and feedback.
